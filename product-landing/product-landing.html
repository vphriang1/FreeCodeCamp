      <h2>Ninja food</h2>
      Our medical ninja has crafted to-go foods that optimizes the mind, body,
      and psychic fuel/chakra. But be careful, certain food balls do not go well
      together during the same meal because it's chemical make up could cancel
      out the other food pill or worse have detrimintal effects on the body. If
      you eat two food balls that do not go togther, the body could end up
      creating enzymes that would better be more suited in breaking down one
      food ball over the other. You want the optimal result from eating so
      knowledge of food theory is vital.

      <h2>Ninja tools</h2>
      It is crucial that ninjas have many tools in their arsenal. Having the
      right tool could mean life or death. If you need to untie a friend from a
      trap, you'll need a kunai knife. If you need to retreat and escape you'll
      need portable smoke bombs. If you need to break into a compound, light
      weight paper bombs could suffice.

      <h2>Ninja gear</h2>
      In the leaf village we wear a vest, we have our headband, and also our own
      style. Here in the Leaf Village Ninja Tool Shop there are so many stylish
      gears to help you look good while you are good on the battle field.
