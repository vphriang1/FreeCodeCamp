        <h2>The Evolution Of Our Beloved Sensei</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Genin Years</h3>
        <p>
          Lord Jiraiya was a Leaf Shinobi like no other. This handsome sizzling
          devil of the leaf started off as a rascal trouble maker. His mischief
          included spying on girls, pulling pranks, and compulsive boasting.

        <p>
          He also got in touch with his spirit animal. Through the guidance of
          toads, Lord Jiraiya learned how to utilize the rare technique of sage
          mode in toad form.

        <h3>Chunin Years</h3>
        <h3>Jonin Years</h3>
        <p>
          Despite his smug background, he grew up to become an extraordinary
          shinobi. A master of disguise and esponiage, Lord Jiraiya was
          entrusted to dozens of A level missions. He traveled the land taking
          on many challenges many dared not to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is so much to say about this legendary hero. Needless to say,
          his greatness is so superb, we can not honor him enough.
        </p>
        <h2>Lineage</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Lord Jiraiya was trained by the third Hokage and then became the
          teacher of the fourth Hokage. When the third Shinobi war commenced,
          Lord Jiraiya triumphed as one of the three legendary Sanin. For those
          who do not know what a Sanin is, a legendary Sanin is a war hero whom
          put an end to a great war.
